# Web-Design-Challenge - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Homework submission:

The folder structure in this repository is as followed: </br>
1. Folder "resources" contains: input data file _cities.csv_ and all the provided weather images (stored in the subfolder called "assets")
2. Folder "js" contains: java script file
3. Folder "css" contains: extract of Bootswatch (superhero theme for the bonus points) and local customised styling (_style.css_)
4. Other files:
    * Jupyter notebook: _csv_data_to_html_table_ is for converting the file cities.csv into html format and exported the data temporarily into the file _data_table_x.html_ (without bootstrap formating). 
    * and all the required html files.
5. URL of github page: https://gigi8android.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

**_Notes:_** </br>
  - File _nav.html_ is containing tags & styling only for the navitation bar that can be called from other html files.
  - The landing/ main/ home page is called _index.html_
  - The contents of file _data_table_x.html_ had been manipulating by updating with bootstraps styling to make it more presentatable and meet the homework requirements. Therefore it has been replaced by file _Data.html_.
  - Some styling techniques had been applied to the web pages, such as dynamic navigation bar, mouse hover zoom, tool tip text and static table header.
  - The web pages should be opened with "Visual Studio Code - Live Server" due to the use of javascript, Bootstrap and Bootswatch styling.
